Winsocket host in D

This is a sample host implementation of [RFC 6455](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455), which lets web browsers use
streaming sockets for real time applications. It is fairly complete, and is verified to work with Firefox and Chrome,
and should work with any other compliant browser.
